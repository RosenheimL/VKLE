--GhostJam2024 Release--
Thank You For Downloading The The VKLE Ghost!
While This Ghost has some Big Plans for the Future I wanted To get down some of the general Basic stuff first, and that's this 1.0 release, Which is happening During Ghost Jam 2024
This Ghost Is also a Ghost I am developing as away to make me learn Japanese, while providing a tool to other that want to learn as well.
To Anyone Familiar with Japanese; Apologies for some gratuitous Google Translate that's probably going on in Yuki's Dialogue! I hope It's at least tolerable to read
